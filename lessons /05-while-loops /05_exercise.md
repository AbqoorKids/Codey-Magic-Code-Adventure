# Exercise Lesson 05 — Loops with while

1. Run all lesson files (tickets, circles, icecream, gifts) and change the initial values (for example, tickets = 6 or money = 1) and notice how the output changes.

2. (Challenge) Modify the file `05_icecream.py` to print the name of each flavor from a list (for example ["Strawberry", "Chocolate", "Pistachio", "Vanilla"]) while eating it, and make sure it does not repeat the same flavor after finishing it.

3. (Practical warning) Try removing `tickets = tickets - 1` from `05_tickets.py` and see what happens (do not close the page — use Ctrl+C to stop the program). Record what you learned about infinite loops.
