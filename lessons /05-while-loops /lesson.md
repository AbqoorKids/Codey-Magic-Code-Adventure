# üîÅ Lesson 05 ‚Äî Loops with while: Smart Repetition

## What will we learn?
- What a `while` loop is, and how it repeats something as long as the condition is true.
- How to stop the loop by changing something inside it (`counter`) or using `break`.
- The danger of infinite loops and how to avoid them.

---

## Important points
- A `while` loop says: "As long as this condition is true, do these steps".
- We must change something inside the loop so that the condition becomes false eventually, otherwise it will run forever!
- We can use `and`, `or` with `while` to create smart stopping conditions.
