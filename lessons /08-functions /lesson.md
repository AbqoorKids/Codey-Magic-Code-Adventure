# Lesson 08 â€” ðŸ§¼ Functions: Order and Efficiency in Programming

## What will we learn?
- What is a **Function** in Python?
- How to create a function using `def`.
- How to call a function to perform the tasks inside it.
- How a function can call another function.

---

## Key concepts
- A function is a **block of instructions** with a name, which we can execute anytime by calling it.
- We use the keyword `def` to create a function.
- A function can contain any type of instructions: print statements, loops, conditions, and even calls to other functions.
- If we call the function multiple times, it will execute the same instructions each time.

## Files in this lesson:
- **08_clean_room.py** â€” A simple function to clean a room.
- **08_Noah_tasks.py** â€” A function named Husam containing his daily tasks.
- **08_clean_shelves.py** â€” A function containing a loop for repetition.
- **08_clean_music_room.py** â€” A function that calls another function.

## Remember:
- If we do not call a function, the instructions inside it will not execute.
- A function can call another function, which is useful for organizing code.
