# Lesson 01 — Programming Basics: Variables, Conditions, and Math Operations

## What will we learn?
- What **variables** are and how to name them (a variable is like a **magic box** where you can keep something safe ✨📦).  
- Simple math operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.  
- How to check if a number is **even or odd** using `%` (the remainder operator).  
- Fun Python examples you can run and play with! 🐍💻

## Quick Explanation
A **variable** is a place where we store a value. We give it a name so we can use it later.  
Example: `apples = 4` → here `apples` is the variable name and `4` is the value.  

**Math operations**:  
- Addition: `+` → `2 + 3 = 5`  
- Subtraction: `-` → `5 - 2 = 3`  
- Multiplication: `*` → `3 * 2 = 6`  
- Division: `/` → `6 / 2 = 3.0`  
- Remainder: `%` → `5 % 2 = 1`  

**Simple conditions**: We use `if` to test something:
```python
if apples % 2 == 0:
    print("Even")
