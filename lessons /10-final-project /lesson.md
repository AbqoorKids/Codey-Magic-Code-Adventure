# Lesson 10: ðŸ§  Final Project - A Little Programmer Solving Challenges!

In this lesson, we will apply everything we learned in the previous lessons in one complete and coherent project.  
The project is a simple program that helps us choose the right items for a room based on the available space.

### Project Steps:
1. We have a list of items and their space (in square meters).  
2. Display the number of available items.  
3. Print the list of items with the space required for each one.  
4. Take 5 choices from the user from this list.  
5. Calculate the total space needed for the selected items.  
6. Inform the user if the space is enough to place these items in the room or not.  
7. Display the items chosen by the user sorted alphabetically.

### What will you learn from this project?
- How to work with 2D lists.  
- Using nested loops.  
- Handling user input.  
- Using conditions to check the space.  
- Sorting lists using the `sorted()` function.  

### Additional Challenges (Optional):
- Modify the program to take the number of chosen items dynamically from the user instead of 5.  
- Add a feature to calculate the remaining space in the room after selecting items.  
- Validate the user input (names must be from the list only).
