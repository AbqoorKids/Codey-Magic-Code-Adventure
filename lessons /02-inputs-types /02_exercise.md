# Exercise Lesson 02 â€” Input and Types

1. Run `02_name_age.py` and type your name and then your age. What does the program print if you type 9? What if you type 12?

2. Try typing text instead of a number in `02_crowns.py` (for example, "five"); what happens? (Hint: it will give an error).

3. Modify `02_kangaroo.py` so that it prints:
   - "The kangaroo is very small" if the age is less than 3.
   - "The kangaroo is a baby" if the age is between 3 and 9.
   - "The kangaroo is big" if the age is 10 or more.

4. (Challenge) Add in `02_type_demo.py` a line that prints `age + 5` after converting it to int. What happens if you forget the conversion and write `age_text + 5` instead?
