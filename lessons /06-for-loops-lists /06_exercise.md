# Exercise Lesson 06 — for Loop and Lists

1. Run `06_shells.py` and change the number of repetitions to 3 then 8 — what happens?

2. In `06_count_fish.py` try `range(0, 8)` and notice the difference.

3. In `06_seafood_tasting.py`:
   - Add a new item to the list (for example "Grilled Shrimp") and try running the code.
   - Print the number of items using `len(sea_food)`.

4. In `06_total_weight.py`:
   - Change the number of fish to enter from 3 to 5.
   - (Challenge) Make the program print the average: `average = total_weight / number_of_fish`.

5. (Important) Explain in your own words why we use `for` here instead of `while`?
