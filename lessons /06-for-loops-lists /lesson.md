# Lesson 06 — 🏖️ for Loop and Fun Lists

## What will we learn?
- How to use a `for` loop to repeat something a fixed number of times or over items in a list.
- The difference between `for` and `while`.
- Using `range()` to repeat numbers.
- Iterating over a list and printing its items.

---

## Quick points:
- `for item in my_list:` goes through each item in the list.
- `for i in range(1, 9):` goes through values 1 to 8 (upper limit is not included).
