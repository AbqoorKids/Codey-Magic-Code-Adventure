# Exercise Lesson 04 â€” Smart Review and Deeper Understanding of Conditions

1. Modify the program `04_max_number.py` so that:
   - It asks the user to enter three numbers.
   - It prints the largest number among them.

2. Add an additional condition in your program:
   - If all numbers are equal, print "All numbers are equal".

3. In a new file:
   - Create a variable containing a list of names.
   - Use `type()` to print the type of the variable.
   - Use `type()` to print the type of each name inside the list.

4. Think: What does the following program print?
   ```python
   value = "123"
   print(type(value))
   print(type(int(value)))
