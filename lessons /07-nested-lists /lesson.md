# Lesson 07 — 🌍 Nested Lists and Loops within Loops

## What will we learn?
- What are **Nested Lists**?
- How to iterate over a list inside another list using a `for` loop inside another loop.
- Practical examples: a list of friends and their souvenirs, a list of countries and tourist activities.

---

## Key concepts
- A list can contain any type of data: numbers, text, and even other lists.
- To access an item inside an inner list: use double indexing, like `my_list[0][1]`.
- If we want to iterate over every item in an inner list, use a new `for` loop inside the first loop.

## Remember:
- Loops inside loops are called "Nested Loops".
- Pay attention to indentation — any inner loop must have its lines indented more than the outer loop.
