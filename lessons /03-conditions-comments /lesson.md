# Lesson 03 — Compound Conditions and Code Comments

## What we will learn:
- Combining more than one condition using:
  - `and` — both conditions must be true.
  - `or` — at least one condition is true.
  - Negating a condition using:
  - `not` — the opposite of the condition.
- Code comments using the `#` symbol to explain code or temporarily disable it.

---

## Comments:
- Any line that starts with `#` will not be executed.
- We use comments to explain what the code does or to remind ourselves of something.

Example:
```python
# This is just an explanation line
age = 12  # This sets the user's age
