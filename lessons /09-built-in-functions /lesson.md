# Lesson 09 â€” ðŸš€ Built-in Functions: Ready-Made Magic Tools!

## What will we learn?
- Learn about some **Built-in Functions** in Python.
- How to use these functions to make common operations easier.
- Examples of functions:
  - `len()` â€” count the number of items.
  - `sum()` â€” sum numbers in a list.
  - `sorted()` â€” sort lists.
  - `round()` â€” round numbers.

---

## Key concepts
- Built-in functions are pre-existing functions in Python and do not need to be defined.
- These functions save you time and effort because you donâ€™t have to reinvent the wheel.
- You can pass lists, numbers, or text to these functions and get the result directly.

## Functions we will cover today:
1. **`len()`** â€” to find the length of a list or number of characters in a string.
2. **`sum()`** â€” to add up all numbers in a list.
3. **`sorted()`** â€” to sort items.
4. **`round()`** â€” to round decimal numbers.

## Files in this lesson:
- **09_len_broken_items.py** â€” using `len()` to count items.
- **09_sorted_screws.py** â€” using `sorted()` to sort numbers.
- **09_round_average_brick.py** â€” using `round()` to round numbers.
- **09_sum_prices.py** â€” using multiple built-in functions together.

---

## Remember:
- These functions can be used anytime without defining them.
- You can combine multiple built-in functions in a single operation.
